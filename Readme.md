Assignment:
Responsive Portfolio Website

Objective:
Create a responsive, multi-page portfolio website showcasing your web development skills and previous projects, utilizing HTML, CSS, UX/UI principles, and the Bootstrap framework.

 

Description:
In this project, you will create a responsive, multi-page portfolio website that showcases your web development skills and highlights your past projects. The website should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and follow UX/UI best practices. The website must be built using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.

 

Requirements:
Use HTML and CSS to create the structure and style of the website, including three web pages: home page (index.html), projects page (projects.html), and interests page (interests.html).

The home page must contain a one-paragraph description of yourself and an image (it does not have to be an image of you).
The projects page must feature projects you have worked on and links to some of your GitHub pages.
The interests page should provide information on your general or professional interests.
Include at least two images on any of the three pages, applying CSS properties to each image.

Implement a responsive design using the Bootstrap framework, ensuring the website is optimized for various devices and screen sizes.

Design the website with straightforward navigation and sections, including a header, about me, projects, and contact sections.

The navigation bar must be consistent on each page and provide links to each web page.
Showcase at least three past projects on the projects page, including a brief description, image, and link to each project.

Apply UX/UI design principles to ensure an excellent user experience, focusing on consistency, usability, and visual appeal.

Test the website on multiple devices and browsers to ensure cross-compatibility, addressing any layout or functionality issues.

 

(Optional) Bonus Requirements:
Optimize images and other assets for web performance.
Include a favicon, metadata, and proper HTML semantics for accessibility and SEO purposes.
Using good UX practices, choose a color palette for your web page and add at least three colors to your CSS styles for HTML elements. 
Add 5 animations to at least one web page.
Create a splash screen when you first enter the site. Make it disappear after you scroll or after a given time.
Add a professional-looking footer to the bottom of each of your pages. Make sure they are all the same. Feel free to add links to your social media accounts, github profile, etc.
Implement bootstrap icons on all of your pages where you see necessary.
